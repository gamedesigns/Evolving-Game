## **"Adaptive Game Evolution: Real-Time Co-Adaptive Interaction for Novel Game Mechanics Development"**

Author: Daniel Sandner

### **Abstract**
We present an exploratory viewpoint on adaptive gameplay that enables real-time bidirectional evolution between human players and computational systems. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates how games can dynamically generate new mechanics, visual representations, and auditory feedback based on player behavior, creating emergent complexity that transcends traditional game design structures.
