[![Play Online](https://img.shields.io/badge/Play-Online-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://gamedesigns.github.io/Evolving-Game)

A proof-of-concept web application demonstrating real-time co-adaptive interaction between human players and computational systems through evolving game mechanics.

## Overview

This research platform explores how games can dynamically generate new mechanics, visual representations, and auditory feedback based on player behavior, creating emergent complexity that transcends traditional game design structures. While contemporary games employ adaptive elements in isolated contexts (minigames, difficulty adjustment), this project investigates systematic mechanic evolution as a core design principle.

## Core Concept

**Hypothesis**: Systematic evolution of game mechanics, when implemented consistently rather than as auxiliary features, can fundamentally enrich game design methodology and player experience through real-time bidirectional adaptation.

**Innovation**: Moving beyond parametric adaptation (adjusting existing variables) to qualitative mechanic evolution (introducing entirely new interaction paradigms) driven by player behavior patterns.

## Features

### ðŸŽ® Game Modes
- **Simple Mode**: Enhanced v1 experience with basic evolution progression
- **Classic Evolution**: Progressive complexity with 10+ evolution levels
- **Experimental Evolution**: Rapid adaptation with advanced AI-like features
- **Research Mode**: Maximum data collection for scientific analysis

### ðŸ§¬ Real-Time Evolution System
- **Dynamic Mechanic Generation**: New interaction patterns emerge based on player performance
- **Adaptive Complexity**: System introduces new challenges when players achieve competency thresholds
- **Bidirectional Learning**: Both player and system adapt and influence each other's behavior

### ðŸŽ¨ Multisensory Evolution
- **Visual Mutations**: Color palettes (6 themes) and shape transformations (6 geometric forms)
- **Harmonic Audio**: Musical scale progressions (Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Chromatic) with frequency-based feedback
- **Cross-Modal Integration**: Audio-visual synchronization enhances learning and adaptation

### Customization & Accessibility
- **Theme System**: Dark/Light modes with seamless transitions
- **Granular Controls**: Toggle individual evolution features (shapes, colors, sounds, animations)
- **Performance Options**: Adjustable evolution speed and data collection frequency

### Research Infrastructure
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Performance tracking, adaptation curves, behavioral patterns
- **Data Export**: CSV, JSON, and automated HTML reports for research analysis
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts showing performance trends, evolution adaptations, and player behavioral profiles

### Engagement Systems
- **Achievement Framework**: 9 research-oriented achievements tracking adaptation milestones
- **Challenge System**: Daily and research challenges for sustained engagement
- **Progress Persistence**: Session data and achievement tracking across browser sessions

## Scientific Contribution

This platform serves as both an interactive demonstration and a data collection tool for studying:

- **Human Adaptation Capacity**: How quickly do players adapt to evolving interaction paradigms?
- **Multisensory Integration**: Effects of cross-modal feedback on learning and performance
- **Emergent Behavior**: Novel strategies that emerge from player-system co-evolution
- **Cognitive Load Dynamics**: Performance patterns under increasing complexity
- **Design Methodology**: Framework for implementing adaptive mechanics in interactive systems

## Technical Implementation

- **Technology**: Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (no build process required)
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for real-time harmonic synthesis
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for interactive data displays
- **Persistence**: localStorage for cross-session data retention
- **Compatibility**: Responsive design supporting desktop and mobile devices
